/*
PWM Fading Lab

In this lab, you will be using AnalogWrite() in order to fade your LED using PWM. 

*/

// define 'ledPin' to be an integer equal to a PWM-capable pin

// define an integer 'brightness' that will hold the current state of the LED


// define an integer 'fadeAmount' that will hold the amount that the brightness should change per loop


void setup() {
    // set the pin mode of 'ledPin' as OUTPUT
}

void loop() {
    // write brightness to the ledPin using analogWrite


    // Make a mathematical expression to add the 'fadeAmount' to the 'brightness

    // Check that if the brightness is greater than or equal to 255, then set brightness equal to 0


    // Use the delay() function to delay the loop by 30ms
