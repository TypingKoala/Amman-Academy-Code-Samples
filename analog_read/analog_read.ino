/*
Analog Read Lab

In this lab, you will be reading a voltage value from a potentiometer and printing to the serial monitor and serial plotter.

*/

// initialize an integer variable called 'pot_pin' and set it to equal 3


// initalize an int called 'value' and a float called 'voltage_value' and set both to equal 0



void setup() {
  // start the serial monitor with baud rate 9600

}

void loop() {
  // set value to equal the result of analog reading the pot_pin

  // set voltage_value to equal value/1024

  // print a line to the serial monitor with voltage_value

}
